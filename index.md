## Income, Well-being, and Happiness: A State-Level Analysis

Living in the United States offers diverse experiences, with each state presenting unique financial, educational, healthcare, cost of living, infrastructure, and mental well-being perspectives. While the choice of where to live is often subjective, there are objective measures that can aid in state comparisons. Median income, coupled with living expenses, provides valuable insights into the living standards of residents. Furthermore, a state's commitment to ensuring its citizens' well-being is pivotal. Additionally, while happiness is a subject of psychological discourse, achieving a certain income level enables individuals to access essentials like healthcare and education, contributing to emotional well-being. Crucial elements such as poverty rates, cost of living, public safety, and environmental quality significantly impact people's quality of life.

This data story analyzes state-level data from various sources to evaluate income, well-being, and happiness across all states.

## Infographic for UNDP Accelerator Lab: A Volunteer Project for Viz for Social Goods 

In 2019, UNDP’s Accelerator Labs were built to learn what works and what doesn’t in sustainable development to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in time. One of the three team members of the Accelerator Labs, the solution mapper, has discovered 359 grassroots energy solutions from different regions, demographics, and energy sources in the world. These solutions are promising for UNDP’s Strategic Plan (2022 – 2025), which sets out the ambitious objective of increasing access to clean and affordable energy for 500 million people by speeding up investment in distributed renewable energy solutions. This volunteer project (a Viz for Social Good project) aims to build an interactive dashboard and infographic for the government partners, the international donor community and the general public to advocate for local solutions in achieving SDGs.
